# Help Repository

This repository is intended mostly for code snippets and functions that I have either found helpful at some point to share with others, or code that I wrote for others to assist them with an issue that they were having.  Some code is not my code and I tried to document that in comments when it was the case.

Code in this repository is **not** maintained/updated after the code has been tested and committed to the repository.  If you have any issues, feel free to submit an issue on this repository.
